So I thought there couldn't be a better title than this for my first Blog post.</p>

<p>Hi, I am <strong>Rajdeep Mandrekar</strong>, a passionate <em>Software Developer</em> who loves programming so much that I can <em>code</em> at any hour of the day. Other than programming, I am a total <em>Movie Buff</em>. Be it Bollywood, Tollywood or Hollywood, it simply doesn't matter as long as the movie is good. I am a big <em>Cricket fan</em> (everybody loves Cricket in India. It's like a religion here), and <em>loves Music</em> too.</p>

<p>Actually I wanted to write a Blog for a very long time now. But I wasn't able to decide which Blogging Platform I should use. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blogger</strong> didn't interest me much. Everybody had a Blog on Blogger, and they pretty much looked the same. Plus I wanted more control over my Blog, and my data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wordpress</strong> has grown so much that I think it will be a bit overkill to use <em>wordpress</em> only for Blogging. And I didn't have much time to learn and figure out how wordpress works. Plus I had to buy my own domain name and had to pay for the hosting too if I had used <em>Wordpress</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If there were only 2 Blogging Platforms, <em>Blogger</em> and <em>Wordpress</em>, then I think I would have never created my own Blog. The reason I was interested in having my own Blog was because of <a href='http://jekyllrb.com/' ><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Jekyll</strong> had everything I wanted in a Blogging platform. <em>Light</em>, <em>Open source</em> (which means I can customize pretty much everything), Writing blog posts in <em>Markdown</em>, and the main thing being, I can host it on <a href='https://pages.github.com/' ><em>Github Pages</em></a> for free. The workflow of using Jekyll was very similar to my programming workflow. <em>Code</em>, <em>Commit</em> and <em>Push</em>. Simple!!</p></li>
<li><p>I was almost ready to create my Blog using Jekyll, But then I came across <a href='https://ghost.org/' ><strong>Ghost</strong></a>, another Blogging Platform. It had all the advantages of Jekyll, Plus some additional features, such as the Dashboard to create and manage posts. Moreover it looked Damn Beautiful!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I wasn't able to decide between <em>Jekyll</em> and <em>Ghost</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Jekyll&amp;src=' http://my-ghost-blog.com/hash' >#Jekyll</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Ghost&amp;src=' http://my-ghost-blog.com/hash' >#Ghost</a>??? &#10;I&#39;m so confused!!</p>&mdash; Rajdeep Mandrekar (@rajdeep_26) <a href='https://twitter.com/rajdeep_26/statuses/462689034070802433' >May 3, 2014</a></blockquote>  

<script async src='http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js'  charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>But after some brainstorming and with some research, I thought of going with <em>Ghost</em>.</p>

<p>Though Jekyll acted as a catalyst in starting my own Blog, but the main reason for starting my own Blog was to share some interesting stuff I have been doing/learning at <a href='http://vacationlabs.com/' ><strong>Vacation Labs</strong></a>. The amount of things I have learned there in last 4 months, thought me more about programming and CS, than my 4 years of Engineering.</p>

<p>So, this Blog will be a medium to share whatever I have learned or whatever I have been working on.</p>

<p>Hopefully, You'll love it.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/hello-world-developers-way-of-starting-anything-new/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">16070485-6e66-49f9-8428-8ee89981f45f</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rajdeep Mandrekar]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2014 18:55:19 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
