    	<p><strong>Hello, World!</strong> is the Developers way of starting anything new. So I thought there couldn't be a better title than this for my first Blog post.</p>

<p>Hi, I am <strong>Rajdeep Mandrekar</strong>, a passionate <em>Software Developer</em> who loves programming so much that I can <em>code</em> at any hour of the day. Other than programming, I am a total <em>Movie Buff</em>. Be it Bollywood, Tollywood or Hollywood, it simply doesn't matter as long as the movie is good. I am a big <em>Cricket fan</em> (everybody loves Cricket in India. It's like a religion here), and <em>loves Music</em> too.</p>

<p>Actually I wanted to write a Blog for a very long time now. But I wasn't able to decide which Blogging Platform I should use. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blogger</strong> didn't interest me much. Everybody had a Blog on Blogger, and they pretty much looked the same. Plus I wanted more control over my Blog, and my data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wordpress</strong> has grown so much that I think it will be a bit overkill to use <em>wordpress</em> only for Blogging. And I didn't have much time to learn and figure out how wordpress works. Plus I had to buy my own domain name and had to pay for the hosting too if I had used <em>Wordpress</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If there were only 2 Blogging Platforms, <em>Blogger</em> and <em>Wordpress</em>, then I think I would have never created my own Blog. The reason I was interested in having my own Blog was because of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Jekyll</strong> had everything I wanted in a Blogging platform. <em>Light</em>, <em>Open source</em> (which means I can customize pretty much everything), Writing blog posts in <em>Markdown</em>, and the main thing being, I can host it on <a href="https://pages.github.com/"><em>Github Pages</em></a> for free. The workflow of using Jekyll was very similar to my programming workflow. <em>Code</em>, <em>Commit</em> and <em>Push</em>. Simple!!</p></li>
<li><p>I was almost ready to create my Blog using Jekyll, But then I came across <a href="https://ghost.org/"><strong>Ghost</strong></a>, another Blogging Platform. It had all the advantages of Jekyll, Plus some additional features, such as the Dashboard to create and manage posts. Moreover it looked Damn Beautiful!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I wasn't able to decide between <em>Jekyll</em> and <em>Ghost</em>. But after brainstorming for weeks and with some research, I thought of going with <em>Ghost</em>.</p>

<p>Though Jekyll acted as a catalyst in starting my own Blog, but the main reason for starting my own Blog was to share some interesting stuff I have been doing/learning at <a href="http://vacationlabs.com/"><strong>Vacation Labs</strong></a>. The amount of things I have learned there in last 4 months, thought me more about programming and CS, than my 4 years of Engineering.</p>

<p>So, this Blog will be a medium to share whatever I have learned or whatever I have been working on.</p>

<p>Hopefully, You'll love it.</p>
